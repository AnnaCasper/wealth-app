There were a lot of things I didn't get to and would like to improve if I had more time:

- Improve GraphQL query to return data grouped by primaryAssetCategory and then wealthAssetType, etc.

- Improve Modal to display all relevant asset information including tabs.
- Add styling, format balance number to USD, etc.
